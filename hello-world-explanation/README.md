Alright! Let's break down both assembly programs and the commands provided to understand each component.

---

## **x86 Assembly for Linux using NASM**

1. **NASM Directives & Data Declaration**:

```assembly
section .data
hello db 'Hello, World!',0
```

- `section .data`: This directive defines a data section where we can place initialized data. 
- `hello db 'Hello, World!',0`: This declares a byte array (`db` stands for "declare byte") initialized with the string 'Hello, World!' followed by a null byte (`0`).

2. **Code Section**:

```assembly
section .text
global _start

_start:
```

- `section .text`: This directive starts the section where we put our code.
- `global _start`: This makes the `_start` label globally visible, meaning the linker can see it. It's the entry point of our program.
  
3. **Writing to stdout**:

```assembly
    mov eax, 4           
    mov ebx, 1           
    mov ecx, hello       
    mov edx, 13          
    int 0x80             
```

- `mov eax, 4`: The `eax` register is set to `4`, which is the syscall number for `sys_write` in Linux.
- `mov ebx, 1`: The `ebx` register is set to `1`, representing the file descriptor for stdout.
- `mov ecx, hello`: The `ecx` register is set to the address of our "Hello, World!" string.
- `mov edx, 13`: The `edx` register is set to `13`, the length of the string.
- `int 0x80`: This is an interrupt instruction that invokes the system call.

4. **Exiting the Program**:

```assembly
    mov eax, 1           
    xor ebx, ebx         
    int 0x80             
```

- `mov eax, 1`: The `eax` register is set to `1`, which is the syscall number for `sys_exit`.
- `xor ebx, ebx`: This zeroes out the `ebx` register. It's a common trick in assembly to set a register to zero. It means the program will exit with a return code of 0.
- `int 0x80`: Again, this invokes the system call.

5. **Commands**:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 hello.asm
ld -m elf_i386 -o hello hello.o
./hello
```

- `nasm -f elf32 hello.asm`: This assembles the `hello.asm` file into an object file using the `elf32` format (32-bit ELF format).
- `ld -m elf_i386 -o hello hello.o`: This links the object file into an executable named `hello`.
- `./hello`: Runs the compiled program.

## **ARM Assembly for Embedded Systems (bare metal)**

1. **Global and Data Declaration**:

```assembly
.global _start

.section .data
hello: .asciz "Hello, World!"
```

- `.global _start`: Makes `_start` label globally visible, similar to the x86 example.
- `.asciz "Hello, World!"`: Declares a null-terminated string.

2. **Code Section**:

```assembly
.section .text
_start:
    ldr r0, =0x04             
    ldr r1, =hello            
    bkpt 0xAB                 
```

- `ldr r0, =0x04`: Loads the value `0x04` into the `r0` register. This represents the semihosting call number for `SYS_WRITE0`, which writes a null-terminated string to the debugger console.
- `ldr r1, =hello`: Loads the address of the "Hello, World!" string into the `r1` register.
- `bkpt 0xAB`: This is a breakpoint instruction. When executed, it signals the debugger. If semihosting is enabled, the debugger understands this as a request to perform a semihosting operation.

3. **Endless Loop**:

```assembly
loop:
    b loop                    
```

- This creates an infinite loop. It's common in embedded systems, especially in simple examples, to end with such a loop because there's no OS to return to.

Note: Assembly language is a low-level language specific to a computer architecture. Each instruction directly maps to machine code that the processor can execute. Writing in assembly provides fine-grained control over the program, but it's also more complex and error-prone than high-level languages.
