### Up Next

    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
        Learn to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
        Understand the use of registers like EAX, EBX, etc., for these operations.
        Familiarize yourself with flags, especially the overflow and carry flags, and how they're affected by arithmetic operations.

    Control Flow:
        Study conditional jumps (JE, JNE, JG, JL, etc.) and loops (LOOP, LOOPE, LOOPZ).
        Implement basic programs, such as checking if a number is even or odd, or finding the maximum of two numbers.

    Data Movement and Manipulation:
        Get comfortable with instructions like MOV, LEA, PUSH, POP, etc.
        Learn string operations (STOS, LODS, MOVS, etc.) and their uses.

    Stack and Procedures:
        Understand the role of the stack in function/procedure calls.
        Learn to write and call procedures, understand calling conventions, and how parameters are passed and results returned.

    Advanced I/O:
        Go beyond the basic write system call. Learn about reading input using system calls.
        Try creating simple programs that take user input and process it, e.g., a basic calculator.

    Arrays and Structures:
        Learn to define and manipulate arrays and structures in assembly.
        Implement basic algorithms like searching and sorting on arrays.

    Bit Manipulation:
        Familiarize yourself with bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, SHL, SHR, etc.).
        Explore bit testing and setting/clearing specific bits in a byte or word.

    Memory Management:
        Dive into memory segmentation, selectors, and descriptors.
        Explore the use of segments like DS, SS, CS, etc.

    Inline Assembly:
        Learn how to embed assembly code within C or C++ programs. This will give you a perspective on how high-level and low-level code can interoperate.

    Debugging and Tools:
        Get hands-on experience with debugging tools like gdb.
        Learn about disassemblers and how to read disassembled code.

    Advanced Topics (if you're still interested and want to go deeper):
        Dive into hardware interrupts, exception handling, and system-level programming.
        Explore the Floating Point Unit (FPU) instructions for mathematical and trigonometric operations.
